v.2.0

This module is the main entry point for the 'rollocomponent' suite.
The suite provides utilities for using and authoring web components
with a declarative JSX-like syntax.

The 'component' utility constitutes the basic Rollo components. 
In addition to these, the 'rollocomponent' suite provides tools
for authoring autonomous web components that can be used in 
combination with and offers the same API as the basic Rollo components.
