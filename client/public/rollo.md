Rollo Manifesto

Vision

Rollo is a modern, lightweight, and declarative JavaScript framework designed to embrace native web capabilities while offering a powerful reactive and component-based architecture. It prioritizes simplicity, modularity, and developer freedom without unnecessary abstractions.

Core Principles

1️⃣ State is Persistent, Not Necessarily DOM-Bound

State may be persistent, not necessarily DOM-bound. Elements may—whenever it makes sense—retain configuration even when removed.

Rollo does not impose a rigid "only work when connected" rule.

Components and elements may maintain their state even when detached from the DOM.

This ensures smooth reinsertion, avoids redundant reconfiguration, and keeps code declarative.

2️⃣ Declarative Over Imperative

Express what should happen, not how it happens.

Rollo favors declarative APIs that reduce boilerplate.

State-driven updates should be automatic, predictable, and efficient.

3️⃣ Embrace Native Web Technologies

Use the platform—don’t fight it.

Web Components, CSS Custom Properties, MutationObserver, and Shadow DOM are first-class citizens.

Rollo leverages native capabilities instead of abstracting them away.

The framework complements the web platform rather than reinventing it.

4️⃣ Minimalism & Performance

Less is more—lean, modular, and efficient.

Rollo avoids bloat and unnecessary dependencies.

Core utilities are designed to be lightweight and extendable.

No framework lock-in—Rollo should integrate seamlessly with other libraries (Vue, React, etc.).

5️⃣ Developer Freedom

Guided, not dictated.

Rollo provides strong defaults but does not enforce rigid patterns.

Developers can structure components as needed while benefiting from Rollo’s utilities.

The framework should enable creativity, not constrain it.

6️⃣ Explicit Over Implicit

Clarity over magic.

No hidden behaviors—Rollo prioritizes transparency.

Functionality should be easy to debug and reason about.

Future Direction

As Rollo evolves, this manifesto will grow—always aligning with performance, simplicity, and the power of the web platform.
